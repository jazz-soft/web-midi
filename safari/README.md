# Extension for Safari

## web-midi

#### For Safari v.12 and up.

For those without a developer certificate,
Safari requires quite a ceremonial dance *each time* you need to reload the extension:

- Go to `Safari`->`Preferences`->`Extensions` and uninstall the previous version of the extension
- Quit Safari completely (with `âŒ˜-Q`)
- Restart Safari
- Check the `Develope`->`Allow Unsigned Extensions` menu item
- Run the extension app (can do it from Xcode)
- In `Safari`->`Preferences`->`Extensions` click the checkbox to enable the extension
